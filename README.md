## Overview

LitePolis is an advanced, Python-based infrastructure designed for building **customizable opinion collection systems**, extending beyond the capabilities of the original [Polis](https://github.com/compdemocracy/polis). It offers a **developer-friendly** environment focused on flexibility and power.

Built with a modular, microservice-like architecture, LitePolis is **distributed by default**, leveraging the [Ray framework](https://www.ray.io/) for inherent **auto-scaling** capabilities right out of the box. This ensures your applications can handle large groups and high traffic volumes efficiently.

The core of LitePolis is a central package manager that discovers and orchestrates various components â€“ API Routers, Middleware, and UI Packages. This modularity allows developers and data scientists to easily build, deploy, and iterate on sophisticated data-driven e-democracy tools and other opinion-gathering applications.

litepolis-cli deploy init-config

# setup password etc.
nano ~/.litepolis/config.conf

# start serving
litepolis-cli deploy serve
```
